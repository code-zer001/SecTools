# INTRO

SECTOOLS is a handy script that makes it easy to install pentesting tools from Kali Linux onto other Linux distributions. While some tools may not work perfectly outside of Kali, this script streamlines the process for users on different distributions. Keep in mind that for the best experience, it's ideal to use Kali Linux directly for accessing these tools

If you're new to cybersecurity and pentesting, you can quickly get started by installing the most commonly used tools provided in the script.

# USAGE

Recommended to use python3

$ pip3 install subprocess os colorama

After the above command,

Run the following commands (Ensure you are in the SecTools directory)

$ sudo python3 SecTools.py

If you are running it for first time select option 1

    1. Add Kali repository
    2. Install Tools
    0. Exit

Then you can install the tools without a problem

# Final note

The script may appear to be a complex solution to a simple problem, but it was created to streamline the process and eliminate the need for manually typing 'apt install -y' for each tool. I hope you find the tool useful, and if you have any suggestions for optimization, your contributions are appreciated.

Thank you for using SECTOOLS! ðŸ˜„
